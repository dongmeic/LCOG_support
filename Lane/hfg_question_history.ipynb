I just want to have a stable home again so my boys and I can have there mom and this mom can sleep at night not worried and feeling like such a failure. I also lost my section 8 because i was suppose to respond to a letter that was sent . but due to covid there was no way i could have gotten any help or asked for a hearing because the housing office was closed to the public because of covid. It was so unfair and all of this happend during the no eviction stage of covid.',\n",

       "       'I lived in a townhouse in Springfield on R st in my early 20’s. Around 2003. Back then it was called HACSA. It helped me through a very rough time as a single mom. We live in Saint Vincent housing right now in Junction City. We were financially affected by Covid and are constantly having a hard time with rent. They were going to evict us if we didn’t have all the back rent money by August 1st. We sold a lot of our belongings, returned bottles and used some of Eltons student loan money. We got caught up but very unsure of how we will continue to be able to pay $750 a month. Elton has around a year and a half left of school. He is getting his degree in Accounting with a minor in Economics. Once he finds a job we will be able to afford more but right now we are struggling. With inflation the price of food has gone up so we run out of food stamps 3 weeks into the month. I’m not sure if you have records of me when I rented the place on R st. If you do I was always on time and I got my deposit back from cleaning the townhouse and taking good care of our home. I didn’t think I would be struggling again like I am. I am a stay at home mom. Cook 3 meals a day and keep my apartment very clean. My 13 yr old has ADHD and requires a lot of help with school work. Between her and our 2 yr old I haven’t been able to work and Elton has so much school work that he studies around 6-8 a day. He is very dedicated and I’m very proud of him. When I lived on R st my rent was 30% of my income which wasn’t much but it really helped me get through without being massively stressed like I am now. I have never appreciated anything more than what HACSA did for me at that time. I have ADHD and suffer from anxiety and depression. But most of my anxiety and depression comes from stressing out about money. I have to take blood pressure medicine which I’m having a really hard time with the side effects. I really hope it is possible to find a new home. I would like to be in the area that Abbie Lane is or one of the places near Coburg rd. The 2 places near Winco and Costco would be great too. I was going through my files and stumbled upon old HACSA paperwork and thought to look it up to see if any waiting lists are open and am very excited that this website allowed me to get on one. Even the thought of it helped my stress level tonight. I have felt so sick lately with the thought of us possibly being homeless. Even hope helps a little. I wish this form let me select more than one location but I am happy to at least be on one.',\n",
