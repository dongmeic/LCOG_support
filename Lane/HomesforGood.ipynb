       " 'noah is living with his grandma petra in prineville OR,hunter and finn are sleeping at there grandma tammys house in springfield, I sleep in my car most nights. i shower and some nights sleep at tammys home . but there is only room  for hunter and finn.during covid i got really sick and almost died my childeren went to visit there grandpa in vegas. after i got better i drove to vegas and the last hour of the 16 hour drive i became very tired fell asleep. i hit a pile of dirt and my car flew 200 feet when my car touched the ground it broke my back when igot home to attend my moms funeral i couldnt get in my house i was evicted with no notice and everything i owned was thrown away despite contacting the apartment owners. since then i have not been able to get a home and my boys and i have had to live seperated places. we are all tired and just want are family back together. theses last two have been the worst two years of my life.  I just want to have a stable home again so my boys and I can have there mom and this mom can sleep at night not worried and feeling like such a failure. I also lost my section 8 because i was suppose to respond to a letter that was sent . but due to covid there was no way i could have gotten any help or asked for a hearing because the housing office was closed to the public because of covid. It was so unfair and all of this happend during the no eviction stage of covid.',\n",

The community here is not accepting of our family and in fact constantly reminds us that we will be going to hell for it. Our son is deaf but has two cochlear implants. He also has ADHD and high functioning autism which has created issues for him in public school with bullying. He has come home with bruises on his side from being kicked by older kids who dont understand his unique set of circumstances and how he sees the world differently from them. \\n\\nWe want a fresh start where he can thrive and grow to become a successful member of society instead of the terrified shell he has become due to this area. My partner has hearing loss as well and relies on reading lips for communication even with her hearing aid and one cochlear. I will be seeking new employment if we are lucky enough to escape the hell we now find ourselves in. It is a struggle to get by when my partner isnt given the same opportunities for employment as everyone else and the community looks down on us for the type of family we are. We just want whats best for our son and for him to not have to worry about whether his moms will have enough money for food for the month.',\n",
