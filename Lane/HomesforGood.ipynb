He also has ADHD and high functioning autism which has created issues for him in public school with bullying. He has come home with bruises on his side from being kicked by older kids who dont understand his unique set of circumstances and how he sees the world differently from them. \\n\\nWe want a fresh start where he can thrive and grow to become a successful member of society instead of the terrified shell he has become due to this area. My partner has hearing loss as well and relies on reading lips for communication even with her hearing aid and one cochlear. I will be seeking new employment if we are lucky enough to escape the hell we now find ourselves in. It is a struggle to get by when my partner isnt given the same opportunities for employment as everyone else and the community looks down on us for the type of family we are.

He also has ADHD and high functioning autism which has created issues for him in public school with bullying. He has come home with bruises on his side from being kicked by older kids who dont understand his unique set of circumstances and how he sees the world differently from them. \\n\\nWe want a fresh start where he can thrive and grow to become a successful member of society instead of the terrified shell he has become due to this area. My partner has hearing loss as well and relies on reading lips for communication even with her hearing aid and one cochlear. I will be seeking new employment if we are lucky enough to escape the hell we now find ourselves in. It is a struggle to get by when my partner isnt given the same opportunities for employment as everyone else and the community looks down on us for the type of family we are.
