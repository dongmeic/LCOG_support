FERNS (Forest Activity Electronic Reporting and Notification System) sourced from Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) presents the spatial and temporal patterns of the forest activity acreage by activity type. Data is downloaded from the [ODF maps and data page](ttps://www.oregon.gov/ODF/AboutODF/Pages/MapsData.aspx). The processed data is stored [here](https://services5.arcgis.com/9s1YtFmLS0YTl10F/arcgis/rest/services/FERNS_for_McKenzie_Catchments/FeatureServer).
