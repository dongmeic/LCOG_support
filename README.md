## [FERNS dashboard](https://lcog.maps.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/f003689bcb7f45eca5be6f02baada6c0)

FERNS (Forest Activity Electronic Reporting and Notification System) sourced from Oregon Department of Forestry (ODF) presents the spatial and temporal patterns of the forest activity acreage by activity type. Data is [downloaded](https://github.com/dongmeic/LCOG_support/blob/main/EWEB/1_download_FERNS.ipynb) from the [ODF maps and data page](ttps://www.oregon.gov/ODF/AboutODF/Pages/MapsData.aspx). The processed data is stored [here](https://services5.arcgis.com/9s1YtFmLS0YTl10F/arcgis/rest/services/FERNS_for_McKenzie_Catchments/FeatureServer). The model created by Joel Donnelly is exported to python scripts and run in the ArcPy environment. Edit the [dashboard](https://lcog.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=f003689bcb7f45eca5be6f02baada6c0) on the "Data last updated".
