# Middle Housing Project

The task is to create a shapefile layer of taxlots that are within a walking distance of 1/4 mile to EmX bus stops.

The steps are 1) [creating EmX bus stops](https://github.com/dongmeic/LCOG_support/blob/main/EUG/Create_EmX_stops.ipynb); 2) [creating service areas from EmX bus stops](https://github.com/dongmeic/LCOG_support/blob/main/EUG/ServiceAreaAnalysis.py); 3) spatial overlay (e.g., intersect) between taxlots and service areas. The last step is done in ArcGIS Pro.
