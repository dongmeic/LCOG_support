# Middle Housing Project

The task is to create a shapefile layer of taxlots that are within a walking distance of 1/4 mile to EmX bus stops.

The steps are 1) creating EmX bus stops; 2) creating service areas from EmX bus stops; 3) spatial overlay (e.g., intersect) between taxlots and service areas.
